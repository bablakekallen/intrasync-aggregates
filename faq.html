                            <h2 class="faq-question">Do you offer financing or payment plans?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">Yes. AggLogic is available as an annual subscription with monthly or quarterly payment options. We also work with third-party financing providers for customers who prefer to spread costs over 2-3 years. Many clients find that the efficiency savings and revenue gains from AggLogic more than cover the subscription costs within the first few months, making it cash-flow positive quickly. Remember: zero upfront fees, so you only start paying when your first load ships.</p>
