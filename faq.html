            "text": "You can start with just AggLogic Schedule as a standalone module. Many clients begin with scheduling to solve their most urgent pain point, then add other modules as they see results. The modular architecture means you can start small and expand over time without re-implementation. However, most plants find that combining Schedule with Flow (real-time tracking) and Stock (yard management) delivers the most immediate value because these workflows are tightly connected."

                            <p class="faq-answer">We offer personalized demos using your actual production data and workflows to show real-world results specific to your operations. We can also arrange site visits to see AggLogic in action at similar plants in your region. While we don't offer free trials due to the implementation effort required, we provide detailed ROI projections and reference customers you can speak with directly.</p>

                            <p class="faq-answer">AggLogic scales from small plants producing 500 pieces annually to large facilities producing 50,000+ pieces. Our modular approach allows you to build a package with only the features you need, ensuring a cost-effective solution for any size operation.</p>

                            <h2 class="faq-question">How does the AI scheduling work?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">AggLogic Schedule uses machine learning algorithms to optimize production schedules based on mold availability, cure time requirements, resource constraints, delivery deadlines, and historical performance data. The AI learns from your plant's patterns and continuously improves recommendations. It can generate optimized schedules in minutes that would take schedulers 20+ hours manually, while considering hundreds of variables simultaneously. The system also provides what-if scenario planning for capacity analysis.</p>

                            <h2 class="faq-question">What is computer vision quality control?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">AggLogic Verify uses computer vision cameras and AI to automatically detect defects during production. The system can identify surface imperfections, dimensional inconsistencies, color variations, crack formations, and aggregate distribution issues in real-time. It processes each panel in 2-3 seconds versus 8-15 minutes for manual inspection. The AI has been trained on 10,000+ readymix and aggregates products and achieves 99% accuracy in defect detection, catching issues 90% earlier in the production process before they become costly reworks.</p>

                            <h2 class="faq-question">Can AggLogic handle both architectural and utility products?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">Yes. AggLogic is designed to handle the full spectrum of readymix and aggregates products. For architectural/custom work, it manages complex BIM models, unique specifications, custom molds, and multi-component deliveries with precise sequencing. For utility/repetitive products, it optimizes high-volume production lines, standardized workflows, and bulk deliveries. Many plants produce both types and use AggLogic to manage their entire operation with a single unified system.</p>

                            <h2 class="faq-question">What if we only need scheduling software?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">You can start with just AggLogic Schedule as a standalone module. Many clients begin with scheduling to solve their most urgent pain point, then add other modules as they see results. The modular architecture means you can start small and expand over time without re-implementation. However, most plants find that combining Schedule with Flow (real-time tracking) and Stock (yard management) delivers the most immediate value because these workflows are tightly connected.</p>

                            <h2 class="faq-question">How often is AggLogic updated?</h2>
                            <p class="faq-answer">AggLogic receives continuous updates with new features released monthly and critical improvements deployed weekly. All updates are automatic and included in your subscription at no additional cost. We maintain backward compatibility so updates never disrupt your operations. Major feature releases happen quarterly and are announced in advance with training materials. Our development roadmap is heavily influenced by customer feedback and industry needs.</p>

For standard support requests, we're available Monday-Friday 8am-6pm Pacific with typical response times under 2 hours. We also monitor system health proactively and often identify and resolve issues before they impact your operations.

                            <p class="faq-answer">Yes. AggLogic is available as an annual subscription with monthly or quarterly payment options. We also work with third-party financing providers for customers who prefer to spread costs over 2-3 years. Many clients find that the efficiency savings and revenue gains from AggLogic more than cover the subscription costs within the first few months, making it cash-flow positive quickly.</p>

                            <p class="faq-answer">Yes.

The platform includes configurable workflows, custom fields, and flexible reporting. For specialized requirements, our team can develop custom modules or integrations. We've built custom solutions for plants with proprietary processes, specialty products, and unique business requirements. Custom development is quoted separately based on complexity.</p>
